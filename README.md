This repository is a playground for testing the Claude Code + GitHub integration!

Everyone feel free to join and play.

The Claude integration can be found here:
- Claude CI: [`.github/workflows/claude.yaml`](./.github/workflows/claude.yaml)
- [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md)

It does 3 things:

1. Automatic reviews for internal PRs
2. On-demand reviews for external PRs (via `@claude review`)
3. Trigger actions with `@claude` and tell it what to do

Check out [issues](https://github.com/flashbots/go-template-claude-playground/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/flashbots/go-template-claude-playground/pulls), and feel free to create some!
